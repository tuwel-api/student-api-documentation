# Student TUWEL-API

The Student TUWEL-API is supposed to allow programmatic access to TUWEL-functionality, relevant to students.
We provide functionality for you to:

 * get or submit assignments
 * read in your grades
 * interact with the TUWEL-calendar
 * & more!

Proceed  to the [Getting Started](getting_started.md) page to learn how to use it.
